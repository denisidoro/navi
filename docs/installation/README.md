## Using the installation script

Navi has an installation script ready for you to use, you can call it like this:

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisidoro/navi/master/scripts/install)
```

If you need to define the directory for the binary, you can call it like this:

```bash
BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisidoro/navi/master/scripts/install)
```

## Downloading pre-compiled binaries

With each release, we try our best to build and publish a binary for each
supported platform, you can find them here:
[@denisidoro/navi/releases/latest](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/releases/latest)

What you need to do is:

- to download the binary corresponding to the version you want to install
- to extract the content of the archive to your `$PATH`

## Building from source

You can also build navi from source, it's mainly used by contributors to
test their modifications but can be used by end users who want to build their own version.

- You need to clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/denisidoro/navi && cd navi
    ```

- Call `make`

    ```bash
    make install
    ```

You can specify the binary directory with:

```bash
make BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin install
```

## Compile time environment variables
