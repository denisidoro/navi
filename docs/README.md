## About

Navi is an interactive cheatsheet tool for the command-line.\
It allows you to browse through cheatsheets (that you may write yourself or download from maintainers) and execute commands.

[![Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/406461.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/406461)

It uses [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim), or [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) under the hood and it can be either used as a command or as a shell widget (_Ã  la_ Ctrl-R).

## Navi Pros

- it will spare you from knowing CLIs by heart
- it will spare you from copy-pasting output from intermediate commands
- it will make you type less
- it will teach you new one-liners
