# navi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisidoro/navi/master/assets/icon.png" alt="icon" height="28px"/> [![Actions Status](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/actions) ![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/denisidoro/navi?include_prereleases)

An interactive cheatsheet tool for the command-line.

[![Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/406461.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/406461)

**navi** allows you to browse through cheatsheets (that you may write yourself or download from maintainers) and execute commands. Suggested values for arguments are dynamically displayed in a list.

## Pros

- it will spare you from knowing CLIs by heart
- it will spare you from copy-pasting output from intermediate commands
- it will make you type less
- it will teach you new one-liners

It uses [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) or [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim) under the hood and it can be either used as a command or as a shell widget (_Ã  la_ Ctrl-R).

## Cheatsheet syntax

Cheatsheets are described in `.cheat` files that look like this:

```sh
% git, code

# Change branch
git checkout <branch>

$ branch: git branch | awk '{print $NF}'
```

The full syntax and examples can be found [here](docs/cheatsheet/syntax/README.md).
